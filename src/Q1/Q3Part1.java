ii)
    Motive Behind design-: To Solve the problem in a brute force manner so that we can have a pseudocode initially
    which we can optimize later on if asked.
    Talking about the Algorithm, We are just trying to maximise the difference between the two elements using nested
    loops and trying to capture the farthest indexes
    For Successive tetradic numbers, we are just iterating the array and trying to maximise the difference between
    adjacent elements.
    We are capturing the elements which gave us the maximum difference in variable consecutiveFirst and consecutiveSecond
    respectively.

iii)
     Time Complexity-: O(N^2)
     Since we are iterating in a nested loop, so it will cost us TC-: O(N^2)
     Other operations are constant time only
     so taking the maximum as the worst case time complexity will be
     O(N^2)

iV)
    Since we are not using any extra space so the size of space stack growth will be
    constant
    i:e O(1)
